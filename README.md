# My Elastic Stack Playground

To get some hands-on experience with [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/), 
I installed the software in a Hyper-V VM on my Microsoft Windows 10 Pro system. 

- [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) describes the configuration of the Hyper-V VM, 
  the installation of [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) in this VM, 
  and the installation of [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/).
